# Specification Quality Checklist: Evidence Contract Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before planning
**Created**: 2026-07-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1 passed all 16 items.
- Technical mechanisms named by the governing decisions, including RFC 8785, SHA-256,
  JSON Schema 2020-12, and W3C mapping candidates, are contract constraints rather than
  implementation prescriptions.
- No formal clarification question is required; scope, version policy, trust behavior,
  anchor classes, compatibility, and non-goals are explicit.
